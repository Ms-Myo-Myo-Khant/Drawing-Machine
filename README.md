***Drawing Machine***

The Drawing Machine autonomously creates drawings and signatures from user input, stemming from the Maker Mentoring Program which offered training in product design, 2D/3D design, and laser cutter/3D printer operation. 
Leveraging these skills, the Drawing Machine was meticulously built using C and Arduino hardware kits, showcasing seamless integration of technology and creativity.
